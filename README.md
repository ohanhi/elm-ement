# &lt;elm-ement&gt;

**[Go check it out! â†’](http://ohanhi.github.io/elm-ement/)**

This is a proof of concept displaying the possibility to include standalone Elm applications as Custom Elements as per the [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) spec.

`<elm-ement>` does not do anything useful - it is merely a demonstration of how the beautiful functional [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/) can be used interoperably with any other HTML5 content through the familiar Web Components system.
